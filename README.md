This repository demonstrates a common programming error in Python: the ZeroDivisionError. The `bug.py` file contains code that causes this error when an empty list is passed to the `calculate_average` function. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a solution to handle this error gracefully by returning 0 when an empty list is encountered. This prevents the program from crashing and provides a more robust solution.
